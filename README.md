# Fox Feeder MMU ü¶ä

The FoxFeeder MMU is a low-cost, easy-to-build multi-material unit (MMU) designed to bring advanced multi-material printing capabilities to any 3D printer running Klipper. Inspired by the functionality of the BambuLab AMS, the FoxFeeder MMU is a lightweight low-cost solution that pairs seamlessly with the FriendlyFox macro package and the innovative Slacker sensor for precise filament tracking.

## Features ‚ú®

- Affordable: Designed with cost-effective components, making multi-material printing accessible.
- Customizable Lanes: Choose between 2-lane or 4-lane configurations to suit your needs (additional lanes may be supported in the future)
- Slacker Sensor Integration: Utilizes the Slacker Sensor for real-time monitoring of filament slack and tension through the Bowden tube, ensuring consistent filament flow.
- Seamless Integration: Built to work flawlessly with the FriendlyFox macro package. One .cfg to add and that's it, no plugins needed!
- Ease of Assembly: A straightforward assembly process suitable for hobbyists and newcomers alike.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- A 3D printer with Bowden setup or compatible extruder system.
- A set of printed components for the FoxFeeder (STL files available in the STLs directory).
- Hardware kit (refer to the Bill of Materials).
- Slacker Sensor for filament slack detection (available from the Slacker repository).
- FriendlyFox Macro Package (available from the FriendlyFox repository).

## Assembly Instructions üîß

- Print the Components
  Download the STL files and print them with your preferred settings.
- Prepare the Hardware
  Gather the required hardware components listed in the Bill of Materials.
- Assemble the FoxFeeder
  Follow the detailed step-by-step instructions in the Assembly Guide (still to come).

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

To integrate the FoxFeeder MMU with your printer and firmware:

- Install the FriendlyFox Macro Package, simply copy the FriendlyFox.cfg file into your Klipper instance. Be sure to include it in your printer.cfg
- Configure your slicer to define the number of active lanes.
- Update your printer's Klipper configuration with the provided example configurations in configs/.

## Usage üöÄ

Once set up, the FoxFeeder MMU will:

- Detect and manage filament slack using the Slacker Sensor.
- Switch lanes seamlessly during multi-material prints.
- Operate efficiently and reliably under the control of the FriendlyFox macros.

Refer to the Usage Guide for detailed instructions.

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

- Add support for more lanes (e.g., 6-lane or 8-lane configurations).
- Improve documentation and troubleshooting guides.
- Create community challenges and showcases.
